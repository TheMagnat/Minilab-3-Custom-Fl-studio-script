# Minilab 3 - Custom Fl studio script

My custom script for the Arturia Minilab in FL Studio

## Features

* The whole drum pad get directly replaced by their shift function (**Repeat**, **Stop**, **Play** and **Record**)
* Last pad (***Tap***) become an **Undo** button and with shift a **Redo**
* Third pad (***Prog***) now activate the **Step mode**
* Second pad (***Pad***) now activate the **Wait For Input mode**
* First pad (***Arp***) now activate a **Snap To Scale mode**
* In shift mode, **Arp**, **Pad** and **Prog** functions remain unchanged.

## Snap-to-Scale

Press the first pad (***Arp***) to activate.
You can edit the current scale by maintaining the first pad (***Arp***) pressed and:

- Pressing any keyboard key to select the root note .
- Turn the main encoder (The black knob) to select the scale.

Only Major and Natural Minor available for the moment, hit me up if you want me to add more !

This mode is not linked with the Snap-To-Scale tool from FL Studio since they do not provide any way to access and read the data from the Piano Roll in a MIDI Controller script.
