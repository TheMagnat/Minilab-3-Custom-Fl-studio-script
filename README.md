# Minilab-3-Custom-Fl-studio-script
My custom script for the Arturia Minilab in FL Studio

The whole drum pad get directly replaced by their shift function directly and the Tap button become an Undo (and with shift a Redo) and the prog button become button to activate the step mode.

In shift mode, Arp, Pad and Prog remain unchanged.

New: Added an auto snap-to-scale functionality

## Snap-to-Scale
Press the first pad (Arp) to activate.
You can edit the current scale by maintaining the first pad (Arp) pressed and:
- Pressing any keyboard key to select the root note .
- Turn the main encoder (The black knob) to select the scale.

Only Major and Natural Minor available for the moment, hit me up if you want me to add more !
