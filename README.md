# Minilab-3-Custom-Fl-studio-script
My custom script for the Arturia Minilab in FL Studio

The whole drum pad get directly replaced by their shift function directly and the Tap button become an Undo (and with shift a Redo) and the prog button become button to activate the step mode.
In shift mode, Arp, Pad and Prog remain unchanged.
